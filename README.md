# HW8 Term Project
 Final Obj.Orient Term Project (Cedarlogic gates and wires)

 The files in this program were written to simulate the operation
 and function of circuit logic with gates and wires.
 This includes fucntions for OR, AND, NAND, NOR, XOR, and XNOR.
 *The program was also written to allow configurations with a GUI (specifically WxWidgets)
